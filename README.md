# Movie-compare
A Movie Comparison WebPage which uses Omdb API to get information about the movie and then compare them according to few statistics such as Box Office sum, IMDB Rating, etc. 

The main challenge was to create the autocomplete widget which is reusable with other's code or
even in the same project many times as you can see two search bars.

I learned a lot about reusability of JS code and particularly, how to work with different elements and UI Designing. Code isn't fully refactored, I won't be looking back at it again, but would be working toward neat codes as I go on.

Styling is done primarily using Bulma CSS template library. I have just used Vanilla Javascript for this project.
